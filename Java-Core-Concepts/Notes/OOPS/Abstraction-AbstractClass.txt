Abstract class: A class which is declared using abstract keyword is known as abstract class.
				It can have zero or more abstract methods.
				It can have concrete methods.
				We can't create object for abstract class,because it's an abstract.
				We can create constructor for the abstract class, and this constructor will be executed while creating object of it's child class.
				We can create blocks inside abstract class.
				We can have reference of another object inside abstract class.
				We can create final methods inside abstract class, but we can't use abstract keyword alongwith final keyword(final with abstract is not allowed).
				If a child class unable to provide the implementation for all of it's abstract methods then declare that child class as a abstract class, 
				And give chance to another child classes to provide implementation for rest of the abstract methods.
				We can declare static methods inside abstract class.
				inside interface all the methods are by-default abstract but inside abstract we need use abstract keyword for declaring abstract methods.
				We have to create object for it's child class and access the featurs of abstract class.
				An abstract class reference can hold object of it's child class.
