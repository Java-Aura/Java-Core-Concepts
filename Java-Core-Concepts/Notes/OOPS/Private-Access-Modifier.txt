private access modifier: 

							1) private variables: can be accessed within the same class.
							2) private methods: can't be overrided
							3) private class: can be declared only as inner class.
							4) private constructor: outside the class we can't create object
													In real time private constructors can be used to create singleton class.
													singleton class: the class which generates only object is known  singleton class.
																	 we can create singleton class using private constructor and provide the static method to get object of that class
											
											
									EX:
											public class PrivateConstructor {

													public static void main(String[] args) {
														
														Test.getObject().m2();
														Test.getObject().m2();
													}

												}


												class Test {
													
													private static Test test= null;
													
													private Test() {
														
													}
													
													
													public static Test getObject() {
														
														if(test == null) {
															test = new Test();
														}
														System.out.println(test.hashCode());
														return test;
														
													}
													
													
													public void m2() {
														System.out.println("From singleton class");
													}
													
												}
												
										hashcode(): can be used to get the address location of object within the heap area.
