Arrays in java: Array is an object which can hold similar type of data with fixed length.
				As Array is an object we can get length of an array using length() method.
				Within the array we can store primitive type data as well as object data.
				data in array is ordered, and each element has it's index.
				Array index starts with zero and we get the last element of an array using length-1
				Each array implements Cloneable and Serializable interfaces.
				The Size of an array must be specified by int or short.
				We can access elements of array randomly(Each element can be retrieved in same time).
				
				Syntax:
				       <data-type> <reference-name> = new <data-type>[length];
					   <data-type> <reference-name> = new <data-type>[]{elements};
					  <data-type> <reference-name> = {elements};
					  
				Iterate through array: We can iterate through array using traditional for loop and foreach loop.
				
				
			Object[] array: This array can be used to store any type / non-similar/heterogeneous data.
						   But while iterating we should handle what type we are retrieving otherwise we will get ClassCastException
				ClassCastException is the runtime exception which can be raised while casting one type object into another type of object.
