Based on access there are two types of objects:
												1) mutable objects: These are objects whose state can be changed 
																	the class can be extended.
																	the class members can be modified
												
												2) immutable objects: These are objects whose state can't be changed 
																	  the class can't be extended.
																	  the class members can't be modified
															
												Ways to create immutable objects:
																					i) create class as final class.
																					ii) create all the members as private and final
																					iii) provide only getter methods to access members of a class
																					
																					
																					
																					
											EX:
											
													public class MutableObjects {

														public static void main(String[] args) {
															
															Example1 obj1 = new Example1();
															obj1.h =56;
															
															Example2 obj2 = new Example2();
															System.out.println(obj2.getM1());
															System.out.println(obj2.getK());
														}

													}


													class Example1{
														
														int h = 78;
														
														
													}

													final class Example2{
														
														private final int k = 67;
														
														private final String m1() {
															return "Java";
														}
														
														public String getM1() {
															return m1();
														}
														
														public int getK() {
															return k;
														}
														
													}
