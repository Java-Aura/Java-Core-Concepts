Naming conventions in java:
							
							Type 1: 
									declaring Classes and interfaces: while classes declaring classes and interfaces we should follow pascal case type.
										ex: class TestClassDeclaration{
															}
															
							Type 2: 
									Methods: While declaring methods we should follow camel case type.
									
											Ex: public void methodNameDeclaration{
												
											}
											
							Type 3:
									Variables: variable names should be meaningful.
									ex: String name = "akhil";
										String yuy = "akhil";// should give meaningful name  so avoid declaring such variable names 
									Variable names should not start with _ and $ even though they allowed
										ex: String _test= "test"; //avoid declaring such variable names 
											String $test = "test"; //avoid declaring such variable names 
									Variable name should not be declared with operators
										ex: String +test = "test"; // //avoid declaring such variable names 
									Variable name also should follow camel case type
									No two variables have the same name.unique names we should use.
									
							Type 4:
							
									Constant declaration: constants should be declared with all uppercase type.
										
											ex: final String ADHAAR_NUMBER = "1222432435";
											
							Type 5: 
								
									Package: The prefix of each unique package name should be lowercase and should be any of top level domain names like com,edu,org,gov etc.
											 Then we should follow same variable naming conventions.
											 ex: org.Osamina.Student.Info;
												 gov.Telangana.TSRTC;
											 
											
									
Note: The changes made in one object will not reflect on another object in terms of non-static.
	  But in terms of static the changes made in one object will reflect all objects created for the class.
	  
								  Ex: 
							public class StaticNonStatic {

								public static void main(String[] args) {
									
									StaticNonStaticTest obj = new StaticNonStaticTest(); // one object is created
									
									obj.k=70;
									obj.j=90;
									System.out.println(obj.k); // 70
									System.out.println(obj.j);  //90
									
									StaticNonStaticTest obj1 = new StaticNonStaticTest(); // second object is created
									System.out.println(obj1.k); // 30
									System.out.println(obj1.j);  //90
									
								}

							}

							class StaticNonStaticTest{
								
								int k = 30;
								static int j = 20;
								
							}
