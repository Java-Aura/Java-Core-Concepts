generalization: The process of constructing super class/ parent class by taking common features from it's child classes is known as generalization.
				In this process one object will be created and that object can have all the features of parent class and overriding features of child class.
	 
		Ex:
								public class MainClass {

										public static void main(String[] args) {


											BaseClass obj = new SubClass();// generalization
											obj.display("Test");
											obj.display1();
										}

									}


									class BaseClass{
										public void display(String str) {
											System.out.println("Display from base class: "+ str);
										}
										
										public void display1() {
											System.out.println("display1 from base class");
										}
										
									}

									class SubClass extends BaseClass{
										public void display(String str) {
											System.out.println("Display from sub class: "+ str);
										}
										
										
									}
