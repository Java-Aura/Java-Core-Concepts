Java Programming Format
============================

Every Java programmer should follow the coding format.

	1)Documentation Section:
		this is the section we can add comments for methods.variables etc. which makes the programmer more readable 
		i) Single line comments ex: // single line comments
		ii) Multi line comments ex : /* Multiline comment
		iii) Documentation comments ex: /** documentation comments */
		
		Note: Compiler will ignore the comments.
		
	2)Package Section : In Java we can collect multiple classes as collection is known as package. we can declare package using package keyword.
		syntax: package <package-name>;
		
	3)Import Section : In Java we have predefined classes if we want to use them then we have to import in out programme.
						*) import members from one package into current running program
						syntax: 
								import <package-name>.<class-name>.method-name();
	
	4)Interface Section : in this section we can declare interface(interface can be used to achieve multiple inheritance in Java)
							
							syntax:
										interface <interface-name>;
							
	5)Class section : in this section we can declare classes. we can declare n number of classes in a single Java file.
			
						syntax: 
						
									class <class-name>{
									
									}
	
	
	6)Main method class  : In Java execution starts from main method.
		signature : public static void main(String a[]){
															}
															
																	
	7) methods: is a function which execute some logic

				syntax: 
							<access-modifier> <return-type> <method-name>(){
							
							}
							

Simple java program:


			public class MainClass{
			
			public static void main(String args[]){ 
			
			System.out.println("First java program");
			
			}

			}
			
			main method signature: main method signature is the default signature and with out main method we can't run execute java program.
				public: makes the main available within the project 
				static: Can be accessed with class name directly
				void: return nothing, the main method should not return any value.
				main: method name
				String[]:  the main method should be declared with string array which is ready to accept any type of data
				
			System.out.println: 
			
			System: System is the class available from java.lang package. and this System class has three fields
			
					1)in:  can be used to read input from the user/keyboard.
					2)out: can be used to display the message on console
					3)err: can be used to display error messages.
					
			println() : can be used print message on console. this method print the message and cursor waits in the next line
			print(): this method print the message and cursor waits in the same line.
			
		Ex:	public class SystemClass {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.print("Enter message:");
		String message = sc.nextLine();
		System.out.println(message);

	}

}

Scanner: is the class from java.util package and can be used to read data from keyboard or from any file resource.

			Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
			String message = sc.nextLine(); // for reading string type of data.
			int i = sc.nextInt(); // to read integer type of data.

2)Package Section : In Java we can collect multiple classes as collection is known as package. we can declare package using package keyword.
		syntax: package <package-name>;
		
		user-defined packages: the packages which are declared by the programmer 
		
		syntax: package <package-name>;
		
		pre-defined packages: The packages which are already defined in java programming language
							
							Ex: 
								1)java.lang(language): is the default package, will have all the classes and methods required for default java program.
								2)java.util(utility package): 
								3)java.net(networking):
								4)java.io(input and output):
								
Note : to see the methods available from class use the below syntax
		
		syntax: javap java.util.Scanner
		
				javap: is the keyword to see the methods from the class
